# S3 crab_share

A super simple application to upload files to an S3 bucket and generate a shareable link.

## Usage

```bash
sharepy <file>
```

Options:

| Option        | Default | Description                      |
| ------------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| -e, --expires | 7d      | The time until the link expires. |

## Setup

There are two ways to configure the application. Either by setting the environment variables, or by creating a config file containing the credentials.

### Environment variables

```bash
export S3_URL=
export S3_ACCESS_KEY=
export S3_SECRET_KEY=
```

### Token file

```bash
mkdir ~/.aws
touch ~/.aws/credentials.json
vim ~/.aws/credentials.json
```

The file should have the following format:

```json
{
    "url": "https://s3.domain.com",
    "accessKey": "accessKey",
    "secretKey": "secretKey",
    "api": "s3v4",
    "path": "auto"
}
```

### Config file

```bash
touch ~/.aws/crab_share.json
vim ~/.aws/crab_share.json
```

The file should have the following format:

```json
{
    "bucket": "your-bucket-name",
    "region": "eu-central-1"
}
```
